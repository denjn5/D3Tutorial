<!--- Sunburst Tutorial (d3 v4), Part 3 -->

## Smooth Updates and Sorting
In this tutorial we'll begin with our [Tutorial 2](https://bl.ocks.org/denjn5/f059c1f78f9c39d922b1c208815d18af) Sunburst and add just 2 features:
1) sort slices by size
2) smooth updating based on user input.

We'll explain new features in detail, line-by-line. If we don't explain a line below, it's likely covered in a previous version:
1) [Tutorial 1](https://bl.ocks.org/denjn5/e1cdbbe586ac31747b4a304f8f86efa5): A "No Frills" Sunburst
2) [Tutorial 2](https://bl.ocks.org/denjn5/f059c1f78f9c39d922b1c208815d18af): Add Labels & an External json File

If you're viewing this on [bl.ocks.org page](https://bl.ocks.org/denjn5/3b74baf5edc4ac93d5e487136481c601), scroll to the bottom to see the uninterrupted sunburst code, based on d3 version 4. Feedback welcome.

## Formatting Our Pae
We'll begin by dividing our page into 2 sections (main on the left, and sidebar on the right) and use the CSS style section to tell the browser how big each section is.

``` html
<body>
    <div id="main">  
        <svg></svg>
    </div>
    <div id="sidebar">
        <label><input class="sizeSelect" type="radio" name="mode" value="size" id="radioSize" checked> Size</label>
        <label><input class="sizeSelect"  type="radio" name="mode" value="count" id="radioCount"> Count</label>
    </div>
</body>
```

In our html body we've added several lines to get user input and display it properly (Tutorial 2 body contained only the <svg> tag).
1) <div id="main">...</div> creates our main section. It contains our original <svg> element.
2) <div id="main">...</div> creates our sidebar section.  We'll interact with the user here.
3) <input class="sizeSelect" type="radio" name="mode" value="size" id="radioSize" checked> is our actual radio button element.  
    * class="sizeSelect" so that we can get a hold of it with d3.
    * type="radio" tells html that this is a radio button.
    * name="mode" tells html that all radio buttons with this name act as a unit, so if one is chosen, the others are un-chosen.
    * value="size" is what gets returned when we test to see which radio button is selected.
    * id="radioSize"


``` html
<style>
#main {
  float: left;
  width: 500px;
}

#sidebar {
  float: right;
  width: 200px;
}

</style>
```
